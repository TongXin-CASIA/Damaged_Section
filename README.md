# Damaged_Section
Dataset used in 

Expected Affine: a registration method for damaged section in ssEM

it contains 5 damaged section, their fold/crack label, and their reference section

## Meaning of file names
    *_0.png is the reference section

    *_1.png is the damaged section

    *_m.png is the mask
    
## Section description

SW13L63 was acquired from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Mouse, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of $5nm \times 5nm \times 40nm$. The size of the section is $166490 \times 101570$, and it contains a crack which go across the whole section. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

ZW35L414 was acquired from the whole brain of the
Zebrafish, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of $4nm \times 4nm \times 30nm$. The size of the section is $76800 \times 76800$, and it contains several shallow folds. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

DOLW7 was acquired from the optic lobe of Drosophila, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of $5nm \times 5nm \times 50nm$. The size of the section is $10000 \times 10000$, and it contains a fold which through the whole section.. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/10.

ZW35L414 was acquired from the the whole brain of the
Zebrafish, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of $4nm \times 4nm \times 30nm$. The size of the section is $66560 \times 88064$, and it contains a dendritic fold. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

SS2L30 was acquired from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Mouse, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of $5nm \times 5nm \times 40nm$. The section size is $204800 \times 120832$, and it does not contain any folds or cracks nonlinear deformation. This section is scaled with a factor of 1_32 for the experiment.
