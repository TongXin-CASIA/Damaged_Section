# Damaged_Section
Dataset used in 

Expected Affine: a registration method for damaged section in ssEM

it contains 5 damaged section, their fold/crack label, and their reference section

## Meaning of file names
    *_0.png is the reference section

    *_1.png is the damaged section

    *_m.png is the mask
    
## Section description

SW13L63 was acquired from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Mouse, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of 5nm x 5nm x 40nm. The size of the section is 166490 x 101570, and it contains a crack which go across the whole section. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

ZW35L414 was acquired from the whole brain of the Zebrafish, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of 4nm x 4nm x 30nm. The size of the section is 76800 x 76800, and it contains several shallow folds. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

DOLW7 was acquired from the optic lobe of Drosophila, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of 5nm x 5nm x 50nm. The size of the section is 10000 x 10000, and it contains a fold which through the whole section.. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/10.

ZW35L414 was acquired from the the whole brain of the Zebrafish, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of 4nm x 4nm x 30nm. The size of the section is 66560 x 88064, and it contains a dendritic fold. This image is scaled with a factor of 1/32.

SS2L30 was acquired from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Mouse, imaged using a SEM with a voxel resolution size of 5nm x 5nm x 40nm. The section size is 204800 x 120832, and it does not contain any folds or cracks nonlinear deformation. This section is scaled with a factor of 1/32 for the experiment.
